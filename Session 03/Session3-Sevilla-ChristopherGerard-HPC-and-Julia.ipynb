In the field of physics, the most important data type is ```Number```, as in physics, we deal with very many types of numbers. So it is instructive to look at the different data types of ```Number```s that are available to us in Julia.\n",

    "Reading about ```struct```s, the first impression I got was that it acted like a class -- it was an object that you could use to store data referring to a single object, like a simple point mass. Normally, when we define a point mass, we have to define its position, velocity, acceleration, and mass individually. With the help of a ```struct```, we can compile all of these properties into one ```struct``` named ```PointMass``` for example, so that when we want to define a point mass, we can just call store the values of its properties into one data type,  ```PointMass```.\n",
    "\n",
    "With ```struct```s, like ```class```es, you can put functions inside them so that once you have the basic properties, you can get back a derived property that you are most likely going to use later on in your program. However, apparently this is [not necessarily true](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/06/13/the-real-difference-between-struct-class/) all the time. While you can do pretty much the same basic things with ```struct```s as you would with ```class```es, there are some limitations. In the raw sense, ```struct```s are static variables, which mean you cannot change their values once you initialize them.\n",

Further, we define amplitudes to be a floating point number, while frequencies to be only integers from 1 Hz to 32767 Hz, which is more than enough for us.\n",
